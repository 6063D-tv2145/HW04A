# HW04A Description

My project is a "study clock" in a visually pleasing workspace. Upon reading the assignment instructions, I knew I wanted to mimic the aesthetically pleasing time keeping screensavers I see all over social media, in the niche, 'work setup' content category.
1. Initially, I mocked the visual up in Figma.

2. I went into VSCode and set up the visual as modeled in Figma.

3. First, my 3-level dimension was the 1) date, 2) hour, 3) minute of the day. However, I felt like it was too static.

4. Therefore, I decided to add seconds as well, which meant I had to adjust the clock base and its components to acommodate the change.

5. Finally, I added a clock button, as seen in the final version.
